Using the IOTA Explorer for Transactions and Contracts

Once you start deploying contracts or sending transactions, the IOTA Explorer is an invaluable tool for observing on-chain activity. The explorer is a web-based interface that lets anyone browse the state of the IOTA ledger in real time. Here’s how you can use it and what to look for:
	•	Accessing the Explorer: The official explorer is available at explorer.iota.org (for the IOTA mainnet and relevant networks). For the new IOTA 2.0 (Rebased) testnet, a specialized explorer is hosted at explorer.rebased.iota.org. These interfaces are similar in function, providing searchable access to blocks, transactions, and on-chain objects.
	•	Searching for Transactions: If you have a transaction ID (hash), you can enter it in the explorer’s search bar to find the corresponding transaction record. The explorer will display details such as the sender address, timestamp, gas used, inputs/outputs (objects transferred), and whether the transaction was successful. For example, after executing the token contract’s init function in the earlier example, you could search for the transaction to see the newly created TreasuryCap and CoinMetadata objects and verify they were transferred to the expected addresses.
	•	Browsing Blocks and Network Activity: The IOTA Explorer allows users to browse recent blocks (or milestones/checkpoints in the DAG). You can see the latest blocks, the number of transactions in each, and drill down into them. The explorer updates in real-time, so it’s a good way to visualize throughput. In the IOTA Rebased version, the explorer has been completely redesigned to provide detailed insights into network activity, including real-time tracking of transactions, blocks, and validator metrics ￼. This means you can not only see individual transactions but also get an overview of the network’s performance (TPS, finality times, current epoch, validator participation, etc.) which is useful for understanding the context of your contract execution.
	•	Viewing Objects and Addresses: Because IOTA’s ledger is object-based, the explorer also lets you inspect objects by their ID (which doubles as addresses for owned objects). For instance, if you created a new identity (DID) or a new Coin object, that object has a unique identifier (a 0x-prefixed hash). By searching for that object ID, you can see the object’s data and properties. In case of a smart contract (Move package), when you publish it, it might create a package object or certain resource objects (like our token’s metadata). The explorer would list those under the publishing account’s address or allow direct lookup via ID. This helps in verifying smart contract deployment – you can confirm that your contract’s objects exist on the ledger and even see their content (in raw form). For example, searching the ID of an Identity object (from a DID, see next section) will show its state which includes the DID document bytes stored on chain.
	•	User Interface Features: The explorer typically provides an intuitive UI: you’ll find tabs or sections for Transactions, Blocks/Epochs, Addresses/Objects, and sometimes Charts (for metrics). You might see filters for different types of transactions (for example, showing only user transactions vs. system transactions like epoch transitions). On IOTA’s explorer, you can toggle to show system transactions (like milestone checkpoints) if needed. For smart contracts, if an explorer supports it, it could display the Move package ID and even the module names published, though as of now you might need to rely on your own records or the SDK to interpret raw data.

Overall, the IOTA Explorer is the go-to tool to verify and demonstrate what’s happening on-chain. During development or a presentation, you can deploy a contract or send a DID creation transaction and then use the explorer to walk through the outcome: “Here is the transaction where we created ExampleCoin – note the new object IDs. Here is the DID we created – we can see the DID document on-chain.” This visual confirmation builds confidence and helps in troubleshooting (e.g., if a transaction failed, the explorer would show an error reason in the metadata). Because it’s a public resource, partners can also use the explorer on their own to inspect transactions or identities you’ve shared with them, using just the IDs.
